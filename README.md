# Portfolio-Analysis
Creating an equally-weighted portfolio, finding an optimal portfolio by adjusting weights and comparing their sharpe ratios with those of individual stocks..


----------------------------------- OVERVIEW / OBJECTIVE

This is my first independent analysis of Adjusted Close stock prices.

Our goal is to: 
1) Gain insight on stock performance over time by analyzing close price data, and
2) Create different portfolio options containing these stocks and uncover which portfolio is optimal.

In this analysis, we explore historical Adjusted Close stock price data pertaining to five of the most prestigious financial instituions to gain insight on their performance over time. Then, we create an equally-weighted portfolio, use the Efficient Frontier derive a large set of portfolios with randomly-generated, unequal weights, and find which portfolio is optimal by calculating and comparing their Sharpe Ratios.





----------------------------------- KEY CONCEPTS / TERMINOLOGY


* OHLC Data
* Adjusted Close Price
* Return / Cumulative Return
* Portfolio Expected Return
* Portfolio Risk / Portfolio Standard Deviation
* Efficient Frontier
* Sharpe Ratio / Maximum Sharpe Ratio
* 



----------------------------------- METHODOLOGY

Then, we calculate returns, cumulative returns, and visualize monthly cumulative returns to get a clear idea as to how these financial institutions have performed over time. 

Next, we create an equally-weighted portfolio containing these stocks and analyze its expected return and risk
